Description
-

This Jira app was created for personal learning purposes using Java and Selenium WebDriver. With its user friendly interface, it provided a convenient and efficient way to create issues, log time, and update issue status to "done" in Jira. 
Please note that a runnable jar was not provided because it may not work on different Jira servers due to varying field configurations.
